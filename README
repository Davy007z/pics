Good-looking frontend for Google's Picasaweb photo galleries.
Uses Google Data API to fetch and display your albums and photos.

A small Java application made to be hosted for free on Google App Engine.

For all those you wish their Picasaweb gallery had black background!
Example gallery: http://photos.azib.net/

How to use it for your own photos:

- Clone this repository as described on Github
- Specify your Picasaweb username in src/config.properties
- Specify your AppEngine application ID in web/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml
- Download AppEngine SDK from Google
- Use AppEngine SDK / Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA to deploy your application
  Details here: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/gettingstarted/uploading.html

P.S. the app is a standard Java Servlet-based application, so it will work without AppEngine as well.
